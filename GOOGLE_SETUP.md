## üîê Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the obtained values:

```env
# Google API Configuration

# Google Sheets Configuration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=your-sheet-id-here
```

## üß™ Testing Integration

Run database initialization:

```bash
cd backend
npm run setup
```

## üìä Data Structure in Google Sheets

Each form submission will be added as a new row. Data is written without headers:

**Data order in row:**
1. Submission time (timestamp)
2. Form type ("Form")
3. Name (name)
4. Email (email)
5. Phone (phone)
6. Field 1 value (field_1755855549347)
7. Field 2 value (field_1755855577188)
8. Field 3 value (field_1755855635707)
9. Field 4 value (field_1755855695107)
10. Field 5 value (field_1755855714011)
11. Field 6 value (field_1755855729485)
12. File status ("No file")

**Example row in table:**
```
22.08.2025  Form  test@test.com  22222  2222222222  RTV Euro AGD  Air Purifier AX60R5080WD/EU    true  true  No file
```

**Important**: 
- Headers are not created automatically
- Data is written directly to the table
- Number of columns adapts to form data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
